                <p>Hello! I'm Justin Vachel Myat, a passionate third-year student studying Bachelor of Design at RMIT University. I specialize in 3D modeling and visual effects, with a keen interest in creating captivating environments and props. My goal is to become a VFX artist, focusing on material and texture work that brings ideas to life.

                    I’m experienced in software like Maya and various real-time rendering tools, and I'm eager to expand my skill set to include ZBrush and Unreal Engine. I believe in the power of collaboration and am excited to contribute my creativity and enthusiasm to dynamic teams.
                    
                    In addition to my studies, I'm a tech enthusiast and enjoy exploring the latest in hardware and software. When I’m not immersed in my design work, you can find me gaming or experimenting with photography. I’m always looking to learn and grow, and I’m committed to making a positive impact in the creative industry.
                    
                    Thanks for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting and sharing my journey with you.</p>
